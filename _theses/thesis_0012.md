# Aim
The  project involves the analysis of a detection algorithm for horizontal signage, in particular the lane detection.
The aim is to create the limit zones beyond which the transit of a USAD cinema machine is not allowed, thus guaranteeing security in movement.
A local planner of the autonomously guided vehicle is already present which decides instant by instant all the maneuvers that the kart must perform to maintain one trajectory;
My work consist of integrating in  local planner a control for  not invading the opposite lane on the street.
The framework used is ROS, the algorithm implementation is written in C ++ language, all in a Linux environment.
