# Embedded Systems Development with ARM  
The aim of this project is to develop a system that allows the creation of three-dimensional mapping models for autonomous navigation of IRALAB's robots. To achieve this goal, we started our work with a device composed by a LIDAR (Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging) system, mounted on a rotating platform; this is capable of generating 3D points sets, also called point clouds, in a reference frame in agreement with the platform used.
