# Aim
Currently the global planner of the IRALAB's autonomous driven vehicle operates on image format maps (.png file). In these maps is represented the area where you want the vehicle to carry out the global motion planning. The stage activity will be focused on changing the global planner in order to operate with "openstreetmap" (https://www.openstreetmap.org/) so that the output would be a map on which it can then complete the global planning movement. The framework used will be ROS, changes to the navigation system will be done using C ++, all in Linux environment. It will be necessary to test the work that will be done directly on the vehicle, as the goal is to put the vehicle in the street.
