<!--
This project aims to enhance a deep-learning based system capable of localizing a vehicle inside a LiDAR map using images captured by onboard cameras. The latter is a well-established method first introduced by Daniele Cattaneo in the paper [CMRNet: Camera to LiDAR-Map Registration](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8917470) and further expanded in the subsequent papers by Daniele. The systems hinges on the capability of deep-neural-netoworks to find a correspondences between the points of an existing map made with a LiDAR sensor and the correspondent pixels on the camera image. This matching is completely done by the neural-network acting like a black box, with no information about the reliability of the matching.  

This project propoosal wants to introduce the uncertainty using the methods explored by Matteo Vaghi [1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-47546-7_20) and [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01234) so to create a probabilistic version of CMRNET.  


This specific projects fits well a TFM/graduate work and will hopefull carried on in collaboration with the authors of the aforementioned papers and the University of Milano-Bicocca. It is a good opportunity to work in an international project. -->

## **Description**  
This project aims to enhance a deep-learning-based system capable of localizing a vehicle within a LiDAR-generated map using images captured by onboard cameras. The method builds upon the work introduced by Daniele Cattaneo in [CMRNet: Camera to LiDAR-Map Registration](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8917470) and further expanded in subsequent research. The system relies on deep neural networks to establish correspondences between LiDAR-generated point cloud data and camera-captured images. However, the current approach works as a black box, lacking explicit information about the reliability of these correspondences.  

## **Objective**  
This project proposes integrating uncertainty estimation into the localization process, leveraging probabilistic methods explored by Matteo Vaghi ([Paper 1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-47546-7_20), [Paper 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01234)). The goal is to develop a probabilistic version of CMRNet, enhancing robustness and reliability in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.  

## **Research Scope & Methodology**  
- Deep Learning-based Localization using Camera-to-LiDAR Map Registration.  
- Uncertainty Quantification** in neural network-based perception models.  
- Evaluation of probabilistic approaches within the existing CMRNet framework.  
- Collaboration with research teams at Universidad de AlcalÃ¡ (UAH) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ and UniversitÃ  di Milano-Bicocca (UNIMIB) ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹.  

## **Suitability & Collaboration**  
This project is ideal for Masterâ€™s Thesis (TFM) candidates, offering hands-on experience in deep learning, sensor fusion, and uncertainty estimation. The research will be conducted in collaboration with the authors of the referenced papers and both UAH and UNIMIB, providing an opportunity to contribute to an international research initiative.
