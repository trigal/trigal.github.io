# Aim
Integration and implementation of a dynamic obstacle detector in the ROS Navigation Stack.
The project involves the development of an algorithm for the detection of dynamic obstacles commonly found in the urban environment.
The developed software is integrated in the ROS navigation stack as a plugin that interfaces with the local planer and it's able to represent static and dynamic obstacle on a 2D map.
