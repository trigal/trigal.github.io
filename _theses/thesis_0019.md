# Description of the work:
Use of car's sensor measurements as well as car's motion model for scene layout estimation; development of the software infrastructure; determination of appropriate detectors for the baseline road features, e.g., lane markings (horizontal road markings); customization of the framework to integrate these layout components, integration of the detectors for such components, training of these detectors if appropriate, extensive experimental activity.
