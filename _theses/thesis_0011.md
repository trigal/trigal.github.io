# Aim
Integration and implementation of a simple curb detection algorithm within the ROS navigation stack.
The aim was to implement and integrate an algorithm in the vehicle’s local planner which allow to perform distance checks with reference to the roadway limits to ensure that the vehicle, in addition to follow a path set by the global planner, could be able to move in relationship with its position within the surrounding environment.
The work and the analysis of the data acquired by the vehicle were processed using the ROS framework within Linux environment and the algorithm implementation was done in C++.
Tests were carried out both in simulation and on the vehicle to verify the effective “operation” of the implemented work.
