After approximately one century from the first attempts to create automated driving cars, the recent progress in the context of Intelligent Transportation Systems allows us to consider the autonomous driving cars just a matter of time. From automated driving systems like on-demand next-generation taxis to privately owned self-driving cars, an appropiate awareness of the surrounding environment is a common need to achieve safety, for both drivers and road users. This presentations seeks to provide a basic understanding of one of the key elements in the process of achieving this self-consciusness, presenting the current advances in the field of vehicle localization. We will see together the major challenges and the different approaches both industries and academies are investigating to enable robotize-cars to drive safely in a real world shared with human drivers.
