From 2013 to 2018 I worked as teaching-assistant for the course Computer and Robot Vision, together with Prof. Domenico G. Sorrenti. For this course I prepared the material for the exam and the lectures for the robotics localization topics, including:

* Robot motion (Probabilistic Robotics Ch.6): 3DoF and 6DoF odometry model, sampling algorithm, beam model
* Robot Localization, Monte Carlo (Probabilistic Robotics, Ch.8): MCL, Augmented MCL, KLD-Sampling
* Camera Calibration DLT - Lab Practice
* Camera Calibration using Matlab Toolbox and OpenCV / ROS Tools - Mono & Stereo configuration - Lab Practice
* Simulator, EKF and PF templates (final exam)
