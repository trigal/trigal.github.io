In 2020 during the academic year 2019-20 I have been teaching in the Vehiculos Inteligentes course (Intelligent Vehicles) of the Máster Universitario en Ingeniería de Telecomunicación (Telecommunication Engineering Master Course). 

The topics I covered were:

* localization algorithms introduction with theory and examples 
* particle filters, with a small practice exercise using Matlab templates I developed (thanks to Ignacio Parra Alonso for the adaptation)
* kalman filters, with a small EKF-version practice exercise using Matlab templates I developed (again, thanks I.P.Alonso)

All the classes have been given in Spanish language together with the colleague Iván García Daza who have taught the control theory and relative practice exercises.
