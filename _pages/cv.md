Postdoctoral Experience
=====

After the 4-years PhD period I worked as Research Associate in the Informatics and Robotics for Automation group (IRALAB) of the “Università degli Studi di Milano – Bicocca” in the following projects: 

* 2017 – Autonomously driven road vehicles (Veicoli stradali a guida autonoma, university project code 16A129). 
* 2018 – Perception for autonomously driven vehicles (Percezione per veicoli a guida autonoma, university project code 17A110). 
* 2019 (ongoing) – "Reliable localization algorithms for autonomous driving car", here I was awarded with a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions research grant within the GOT ENERGY TALENT (GET) fellowship programme [link](http://gotenergytalent.uah.es/member/augusto-luis-ballardini/ "MSCA-COFUND")
  

Knowledge Areas: 
====== 
Localization, ITS, autonomous driving, point cloud registration, 3D reconstruction with stereo cameras, visual odometry, conditional random fields, hidden markov models, computer vision, image geometry and transformations, template matching, particle swarm optimization, Robotic Operating System (ROS), montecarlo localization within full 6DoF maps, path planning. 

Skills
======
* 3D pose estimation and Visual Odometry algorithms 
* Computer Vision, Image Formation, Geometry and Projection 
* Kalman filtering, particle filtering 
* Nonlinear optimization, using the g2o framework 
* Proficiency in programming using C++ and the ROS framework (used since Boxturtle version) 
* Comfortable with academic writing 
* Semantic Classification of Road Features (road, sidewalks, traffic markers etc.) leveraging image classification algorithms such as Conditional Random Fields. In 2019 and I collaborated with Dr. Daniele Cattaneo in vehicle localization systems based on DNN approaches.
* I worked in several dataset acquisition and annotation projects in cooperation with the IRALAB team. The most important ones are related to the “A4 Highway dataset” collected in 2017 and the “Intersection Ground Truth and Training Set” sequences based on the KITTI Dataset.  


Complementary skills & competencies 
=====

I worked and organized the following research and experimental/on-the-field activities, including public demos in different environments (closed areas, public areas, rural areas). 

* Sept 2016 Autonomous car driving live demo at “MeetMeTonight 2016”. 
* Sept 2016 Autonomous car driving live demo at “Parco Tecnologico Padano”. For this demo we had our autonomous car driving in outdoor/off-road scenarios. 
* May 2013 Autonomous car driving live demo at “Wired Next Fest” (Innovation festival promoted by the Italian edition of Wired magazine). For this demo we had our autonomous car driving people around for 3 days in an off-road, heavily crowded environment at the city park of Porta Venezia in Milano. 
* March 2013 Autonomous car driving demo, interview and photo session for “Quattro Ruote" (automobile magazine). In this demo we showed the ability of our autonomous car to drive inside an indoor parking lot. 
* January 2013 Indoor autonomous robot navigation demo with “Geo Scienza”, RAI 3 (national television). 
* January 2011 Outdoor autonomous car driving demo with RAI 3 (national television). In this demo we recoded for RAI 3 some sequences of autonomous driving within the University of Milano -Bicocca campus. 
* November 2010 Indoor autonomous car driving demo at the Electrical Intelligent Vehicles Fair 2010 (EIV2010). In this demo we had our autonomous car driving people between stands of the fair for 4 days, moving through small spaces in a highly crowded environment. 

Participation in scientific projects and role in them 
=====

* 2017 – Collaboration with the National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) group on the MOSCAB experiment. I was responsible for the development of the computer vision toolkit. The tool allowed the MOSCAB research group to identify the 3DoF position of bubbles inside a double chamber system, filled with Freon and water, optimizing the refraction indices of the materials in an uncalibrated stereo camera configuration. 
During this project I had the opportunity to work with a completely different team, composed mainly of physicist and material science experts. 
* 2017 – Collaboration with Magneti Marelli group for the development of a monocular visual odometry system. I was the main developer and responsible for the development, testing and acquisition phases. 
* 2016 – Robotic Perception for autonomous driving (Percezione robotica per la guida autonoma, university project code 16A019). During this year I start working on the identification and classification of the upcoming intersections areas, given the images acquired using on-board cameras. 
* 2012 – OMMAVE Project - Multi Sensor Odometry for autonomous vehicles. Università degli studi di Milano – Bicocca. I was responsible for the development of a 3D world simulator, necessary for the testing of a single-plane LIDAR-based localization algorithm.
