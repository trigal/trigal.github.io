It seems that the VPN software we use at my university, a version of Forticlient, has some issues with route creation. Every time I set up Forticlient, all traffic gets redirected to the VPN gateway.

The problem is that some university machines are unknown to that gateway, so whenever I connect to the VPN, I lose access to certain systems. This also happens, for example, with the Anydesk network.

I ended up using the following lines of code to fix the routing. In this setup:
- `192.168.16.10` is the Forticlient VPN server,
- `84.17.62.0` is the Anydesk network (you’ll need to identify this yourself before modifying routes),
- `192.168.151.27` is the IP of my DGX system.

```
# deletes the default forticlient route "ALL GOES TO FORTICLIENT"
sudo route del -net 0.0.0.0 netmask 0.0.0.0 gw 192.168.16.10 dev ppp0 metric 0

# routes 84.17.62.0 which is the network of anydesk to the wired interface directly
sudo route add -net 84.17.62.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 metric 0 dev enx1ce192ff37f8 gw 192.168.67.254

# add a route to the dgx ip address through the forticlient interface (ppp0)
sudo route add -net 192.168.151.27 netmask 255.255.255.255 metric 0 dev ppp0 gw 192.168.16.10
```

Hope that’s helpful :-)
